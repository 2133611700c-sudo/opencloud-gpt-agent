# OpenClaw V2 — Execution Log

Purpose: durable chronological handoff between chats and engineering sessions. Update only with verified work.

## 2026-10-11

### Phase 1 — Foundation [PASS]
- Clean branch `v2/openclaw-clean-20261011`; legacy `main` frozen.
- Foundation CI run `38149188562`: PASS.

### Continuity hardening
- GitHub: `PROJECT_START_HERE.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.json`, master 14-phase roadmap, 48h plan, and this execution log.
- ChatGPT Library mirror: `/OpenClaw-V2-Project`.
- Future chats must restore from canonical files and current GitHub/CI before modifying anything.

### Phase 2 — Persistent State + Durable Kernel core [LOGIC PASS; HOSTED PERSISTENCE NOT YET VERIFIED]
- Core schema run `38152899381`: PASS on PostgreSQL 16 in GitHub Actions.
- Deterministic state machine run `38153032460`: PASS.
- Important: these prove schema/kernel behavior on ephemeral CI PostgreSQL; hosted persistent `DATABASE_URL` still requires live verification.

### Phase 3 — Lease, Fencing, Circuit Breakers [PASS]
- Atomic lease/fencing run `38153301256`: PASS after CI caught and we fixed a real PL/pgSQL ambiguity.
- Budget/token reservation + deadline/steps/attempt breakers run `38154703360`: PASS.
- Async heartbeat manager run `38154875398`: PASS.

### Phase 4 — Lite Orchestrator [PASS]
- Idempotent intake + fixed `Research -> Data/Result` DAG run `38155010163`: PASS.
- Finalizer/failure cascade/deadline/max-steps/deadlock run `38155170623`: PASS.
- Phase 4 core gate: PASS.

### Phase 5 — DeepSeek + Model Accounting prerequisites [IN PROGRESS]
- Before any live model claim, verify `DATABASE_URL` and `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` secret presence without exposing values.
- If `DATABASE_URL` exists: run hosted migration + persistence smoke across separate workflow processes.
- If `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` exists: run real OpenClaw/DeepSeek provider smoke and record model/usage/latency.
- If either is absent: record exact blocker; do not describe that capability as live.

### Current engineering position
- Next action: prerequisite secret-presence gate only.
- Do not advance to browser, vision, swarm, judge, repair or bulk 71/311 migration before the Walking Skeleton live research path passes.
